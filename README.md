 Dice Game Rules
	1.	There are two players.
	2.	On a player’s turn, they can choose one of the following actions:
	•	Roll two six-sided dice: the sum of the roll is added to their total score.
	•	Pass: end their turn and give it to the other player (no change in score).
	3.	Goal: Reach exactly 100 points without going over.
	4.	If a player’s total exceeds 100 after a roll → that player immediately loses, and the other player wins.
	5.	If both players pass consecutively (two passes in a row) → the game ends.
	•	The winner is the player closest to 100.
	6.	If there is a tie after both players pass:
	•	Each player rolls two dice once; the higher total wins.
	•	If that roll is also a tie, repeat this tiebreaker round until one player wins.
	7.	If a player’s total reaches exactly 100 after a roll → that player immediately wins.
